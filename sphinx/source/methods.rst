Reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
----------------------------------

The derivation of ETo had developed over many years with several different equations. The latest and hopefully last variant is derived from the Penman-Montieth equation.

Extensive documentation on the methods and conv=cepts can be found in the `UN-FAO 56 paper <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/X0490E00.htm>`_ [1]

Hargreaves
----------

The derivation for the Hargreaves equation can also be found in the `UN-FAO 56 paper <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e07.htm#an%20alternative%20equation%20for%20eto%20when%20weather%20data%20are%20missing>`_.

The `History and Evaluation of Hargreaves Evapotranspiration Equation <http://onlinecalc.sdsu.edu/onlinehargreaves.pdf>`_[2] is a more detailed description and background of the Hargreaves method.
